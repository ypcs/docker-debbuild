# Helper for building .debs from sources
#
# - fetch source code when necessary
# - install build dependencies based on debian/control
# - build the actual package
#
# and, if you've mounted $your_volume to /artifacts,
# copy build results from container to a directory
# on your host.
#
# And, do only necessary parts as root (uid=0),
# eg. actual build will be done as non-privileged
# user
